## Introduction

This document describes the AXI4 (Advanced eXtensible Interface) SV
UVM1.1 SLAVE Agent. Aligned to AXI4 AMBA spec
<https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0022/hc>

## Slave Agent architecture

![](image.png)

*Fig-1: Slave agent architecture*

The AXI4 slave agent provides following components:

-   uvma_axi_agent_c: UVM Agent

-   uvma_axi_mon_c: Agent monitor, collects and broadcast transactions to
    the sequence in each clock.

-   uvma_axi_slv_seq_c: Generates AXI response to master depending on
    the received transaction from monitor

-   uvma_axi_sqr_c: Sequencer and Synchronizer, receives responses from
    reactive sequence and synchronize responses to driver.

-   uvma_drv_c: drive the vif with the responses received from
    sequencer.

-   uvma_axi_cntxt_c: Agent context, instantiate VIF uma_axi_intf and
    memory uvml_mem. VIF and Memory are accessible in all components
    through context.

-   uva_axi_cfg_c: Agent configuration, all available configuration
    fields are described in Configuration Fields.

-   uvmt_axi_assert_c: Assertion module banded to the AXI interface.

-   axi_transaction: encapsulates the life cycle of a transaction. It
    can be used by any component outside the agent that needs
    information about the AXI transaction.

## Supported AXI4 features

Only SLAVE mode is supported, features are:

-   Out of order transactions : Transactions with different IDs
    can complete in any order

-   Outstanding transactions : Multiple writes or reads
    transactions run at the same time.

-   Channel delay : Randomize the ready to valid latency, for AW, W and
    AR channels.

-   Randomize error injection : inject error by randomizing response
    signal, or by injection error from the sequences.

-   Atomics transactions : the agent support this feature from AXI5.

-   Multiple region signaling : A region identifier, sent on
    the address channel for each transaction. If the master doesn't
    support this feature, the user must configure the memory mapping in
    the test class.

-   Access permissions : access permissions signals can be used
    to protect against illegal transactions. If the master doesn't
    support this feature, the user must configure the memory attribution
    in the test class and the agent will check the access permission
    using the address.

## Agent limitations

The slave axi4 agent does not support:

-   QoS signaling

-   User-defined signaling

The AXI protocol does not define the functions of these signals.

## Agent configuration Fields

-   **is_active**: switch the agent mode to active. The agent support
    two mode UVM_ACTIVE and UVM_PASSIVE.

-   **trn_log_enabled**: Enabling AXI transaction logger when 1.

-   **axi_lock_enabled:** Enabling Exclusive access when 1.

-   **randomization_enabled:** Enabling randomization of response
    signals when 1.

-   **ordering_read_mode**: Ordering mode of read transactions response.
    there are three modes outstanfing, out of order and the regular
    mode.

-   **ordering_write_mode**: Ordering mode of write transactions
    response. (Same mode of read transaction)

-   **max_outstanding_write_trs**: Maximum allowed outstanding write
    transactions depth.

-   **max_outstanding_read_trs**: Maximum outstanding read transactions
    depth.

-   **write_response_latency**: Maximum delay between two read
    outstanding transaction.

-   **read_response_latency**: Maximum delay between two write
    outstanding transaction.

-   **axi_region_enabled:** Enabling multiple region signaling when 1.

-   **axi_prot_enabled:** Enabling access permissions when 1.

-   **cov_model_enabled:** Enabling functional coverage when 1.

-   **m_addr_start/** **m_addr_end:** The first/last memory address.

-   **m_num_part:** Number of memory partition, if the master doesn't
    support AXREGION

-   **m_num_axi_region:** Number of memory region.

-   **m_part_td:** configuration of each memory partition or memory
    region.

## TestBench Integration

In the sv testbench instantiate the VIF and connect it to the DUT master
interface:

   `uvma_axi_intf                axi_if(
                                         .clk(clknrst_if.clk),
                                         .rst_n(clknrst_if.reset_n)
                                      );`

//DUT connection Active mode

   `assign dut.aw_ready = axi_if.aw_ready;`

   `assign dut.ar_ready = axi_if.ar_ready;`

...

   `assign axi_if.aw_valid = dut.aw_valid;`

   `assign axi_if.w_valid  = dut.w_valid;`

Then set the VIF to agent instantiation in env:

     `uvm_config_db#(virtual uvma_axi_intf)::set(.cntxt(null),.inst_name("*"), .field_name("axi_vif"), .value(axi_if));`

In env instantiate and create the AXI agent:

   `uvma_axi_agent_c       axi_agent;
`
   `axi_agent     = uvma_axi_agent_c::type_id::create("axi_agent",this);`

Instantiate, create and set the config to the agent:

   `uvma_axi_cfg_c        axi_cfg;`
   
   `axi_cfg      = uvma_axi_cfg_c::type_id::create("axi_cfg");`

   `uvm_config_db#(uvma_axi_cfg_c)::set(this, "*axi_agent", "cfg",cfg.axi_cfg);`

## Sequences lib

This agent provides 2 sequences:

1.  Preload sequence: this sequence initializes the memory with the
    compiled test.

2.  Slave reactive sequence: generates the appropriate response after he
    take the request decoded by the synchronizer. when the response is
    generated the sequence send it via the driver

## Checks

In order to check the AXI protocol specification, each channel has its
own assertion set.

channels.
